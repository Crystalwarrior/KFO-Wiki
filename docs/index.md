# Welcome to Killing Fever Online Wiki
Killing Fever Online is a server designed for hosting role-plays of all kinds! (Lots of ones with plenty of murder and mystery.) Zero Escape, Danganronpa, Steins;Gate, Ace Attorney, Professor Layton and several other visual novels are our prime inspirations. We enjoy murder mysteries, character drama, creative gameplay and silly plots that make the RP's real fun to be in! We take our RP's seriously, though we value fun above all else, so if you want to be fully immersed in a roleplay we're hoping to achieve that effect!
